# Moonwolf's Anno 1800 Mods

This repository contains all my various Anno 1800 mods.

## Where To Get

All mods are uploaded to my [Mod.io](https://mod.io/g/anno-1800/u/moonwolf287) and can be downloaded from there.  
__Note:__ Some mods require [iModYourAnno](https://github.com/anno-mods/iModYourAnno/releases) to configure.

## Changes

All mods have their own CHANGELOG.md inside the mod specific folder.

## Current Mods

### [Cheat] Customizable Ship Capacity
This mod lets you adjust the Cargo Capacity, Cargo Slots and Item Sockets for every ship seperately to your liking. It also lets you adjust the maximum trade route capacity to reflect the changed values.

### [Cheat] No Royal Taxes
Removes royal taxes completely. There is nothing else done to balance it out.

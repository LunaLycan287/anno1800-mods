![banner](https://github.com/Moonwolf287/anno1800-mods/tree/main/%5BCheat%5D%20Customizable %20Ship%20Capacity/banner.png)

This mod lets you adjust the Cargo Capacity, Cargo Slots and Item Sockets for every ship seperately to your liking. It also lets you adjust the maximum trade route capacity to reflect the changed values.
This mod is meant to be tweaked via [iModYourAnno Mod Manager](https://github.com/anno-mods/iModYourAnno). Otherwise you'll get vanilla values.


Airship support is planned for a future update.
